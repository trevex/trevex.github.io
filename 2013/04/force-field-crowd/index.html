What I did was simple: Every object in the scene had an invisible sphere attached that was pointy where the object was looking. The sphere itself was an elastic physics body without contact friction.</p><p>The final result was a bunch of objects trying to avoid each other but ending up being stuck in each over, but it lead me to an idea how I could implement simple crowd-simulation. If every object similar to a magnetic field has a force field pushing other objects away, they should avoid each other. The result can be even improved by adding in a determination factor, describing how strongly an object is influenced by other objects force fields. The major down-side of this approach is that the work to calculate the force applied on each objects grows with each object by <code>T(n) = O(n*n)</code>, but this shouldn’t be importent for using it within Maya.</p></section> </article></div> <footer id="info"><div class="hcenter"> <section id="contact" class="left"><h1>Contact</h1> <a href="https://twitter.com/niktehpui" title="Twitter"><div class="icon twitter"></div></a> <a href="https://github.com/trevex/" title="Github"><div class="icon github"></div></a> <a href="mailto:niklas.voss@gmail.com" title="Mail"><div class="icon mail"></div></a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/+NiklasVoss/auto" title="Google+"><div class="icon gplus"></div></a> </section> <section id="aboutme" class="justify right"><h1>About me</h1> My name is Nik Voss and I am a CGT (BSc Computer Games Technology) student at the University of Abertay Dundee (UK).
